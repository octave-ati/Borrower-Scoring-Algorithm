# Borrower Scoring Algorithm

In this project, I design a Scoring Algorithm from a dataset about potential borrowers, 
including previous applications, credit card balance and credit bureau data.

This project outlines 2 important part of the data preprocessing pipeline : 
feature selection and data resampling (including SMOTE).

The final model uses a Ridge Classifier to identify borrowers with a high risk of default.
